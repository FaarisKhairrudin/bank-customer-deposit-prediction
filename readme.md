# üè¶ Bank Customer Deposit Prediction - Data Quest 2025

> This project aims to build a predictive model to classify whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit product. It was developed as part of the **Data Quest 2025 Competition** by Data Science Indonesia.

All steps are performed in one notebook: `Modeling_Notebook_All.ipynb`

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Replaced `999` with `-1` in `hari_sejak_kontak_sebelumnya`
- One-hot encoded **low-cardinality categorical columns**
- Mapped ordinal & binary categorical columns to numeric
- Used **CatBoostEncoder** for `pekerjaan` (high cardinality)
- Ordinal encoded `bulan_kontak_terakhir` and `hari_kontak_terakhir`
- Performed **feature engineering**
- Dropped **highly correlated features**
- Selected **top 20 features** based on feature importance

## ‚öñÔ∏è Imbalanced Target Handling

The target variable is imbalanced. To address this, we applied `class_weight='balanced'` in model training.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling & Evaluation

Models Trained:
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **CatBoost**

Each model was tuned using Optuna search, and performance was evaluated using AUC, ROC curve, and learning curve.

## üîó Ensemble Voting

The best performance was achieved using a **Soft Voting Ensemble** combining all four models.
