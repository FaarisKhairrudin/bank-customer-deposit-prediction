### ✨ Background  
In Indonesia’s retail-banking sector, term-deposit campaigns are a key driver of low-cost funding, yet conversion rates hover around only **11 %**. Mass-marketing drives up contact costs and erodes customer experience.

To tackle this, **DataScienceIndonesia** hosted the *Bank Customer Deposit Prediction* challenge (2025). Participants were provided with historical customer data—demographics, financial standing, past campaign interactions, and macro-economic indicators—and tasked with building a **binary-classification model** that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term-deposit product (`1`) or not (`0`).

An accurate model lets banks run **precision marketing**, cutting expenses while boosting *return-on-marketing-spend* and overall customer satisfaction.
